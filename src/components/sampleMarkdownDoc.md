# Why Building a "Hybrid WYSIWYG" Markdown Editor Is So Challenging

Implementing a **hybrid WYSIWYG**-style Markdown editor (where users can both edit raw Markdown and view/modify rich-rendered content _inline_) in the browser is notoriously difficult. Below, I'll explain key reasons for this, using as many Markdown features as possible to demonstrate the complexity.

---

## 1. **Markdown Syntax Is Surprisingly Flexible**

Markdown supports many formatting options, and users often combine them in unpredictable ways:

- **Bold** (`**bold**` or `__bold__`)
- *Italic* (`*italic*` or `_italic_`)
- ***Bold and italic*** (`***both***`)
- ~~Strikethrough~~ (`~~strikethrough~~`)
- [Links](https://github.com)
- `Inline code`
- > Blockquotes

### Lists

#### Unordered

- Item 1
  - Nested item 1a
    - Deeply nested
- Item 2

#### Ordered

1. First
2. Second
   1. Sub-numbered
   2. Another

---

## 2. **Code Fencing and Indented Code**

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

    # Indented code block (4 spaces)
    print("Keep whitespace!")

---

## 3. **Headings and Horizontal Rules**

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
-----
Above is a horizontal rule (three or more dashes).

---

## 4. **Tables**

| Feature      | Supported? | Example                |
|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| Tables       | ✔️         | `| col | col |`        |
| HTML         | ❓         | `<b>Bold HTML</b>`     |
| Task Lists   | ✔️         | `- [x] done`           |

---

## 5. **Task Lists**

- [x] Hybrid editing
- [ ] Real-time preview
- [ ] Collaborative editing

---

## 6. **Images**

---

## 7. **HTML in Markdown**

<div style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Danger: HTML is allowed in Markdown!</div>

---

## 8. **Nested and Mixed Elements**

> **Blockquotes can contain:**
> - Lists
> - `Code`
> - Even [links](https://example.com)

---

## 9. **Escaping and Edge Cases**

You can write a literal asterisk: \*, or a backslash: \\.

# Why Is This Hard for Editors?

## ✨ **Hybrid WYSIWYG**: The Challenges

1. **Ambiguous Parsing**
   - Markdown has many ways to represent the same thing (`*italic*` vs `_italic_`).
   - Mixing formatting (bold + italic + code) creates complex nested DOM structures.

2. **Raw Markdown ↔️ Rich Content Sync**
   - Keeping the raw Markdown and the rendered preview in sync _as you type_ is hard.
   - Edits in rendered view must map back to Markdown source, preserving user intent and quirks.

3. **HTML and Unsafe Content**
   - Users can inject raw HTML.
   - Editors must decide whether to allow, sanitize, or block HTML for security.

4. **Plugins and Extensions**
   - GitHub Flavored Markdown adds features (tables, task lists, etc.).
   - Supporting all of them requires complex, extensible parsing/rendering engines.

5. **Selection, Cursors, and Undo**
   - Mapping user cursor/selections between source and rendered DOM is non-trivial.
   - Undo/redo stacks must work across both representations.

6. **Performance**
   - Real-time parsing and rendering can lag for large documents.

### Example: A Tricky Markdown Snippet

> 1. **Bold**
>    - [ ] Task
>    - `Inline code`
>       - ![img](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png)
>
>    ```
>    Block code inside blockquote
>    ```

## **Conclusion**

A "hybrid WYSIWYG" Markdown editor must handle **all of the above** — and more — in real time, for potentially thousands of users with wildly different Markdown habits. That’s why, despite many attempts, most editors either:

- Stick to raw Markdown with preview, **OR**
- Offer limited WYSIWYG features, with some Markdown features unsupported or broken.
